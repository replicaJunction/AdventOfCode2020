# Advent of Code 2020

This repository is my attempt to complete the exercises in the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) programming challenge for 2020. I've chosen to work in F# this year - I've been doing some F# work in production for my day job, and I'm interested in honing my functional programming skills.

If you're working on the Advent of Code challenges yourself, I strongly recommend you try to complete each exercise on your own before looking at my solutions.

**Note:** These files also contain my example puzzle inputs. These will probably NOT match your puzzle inputs.
